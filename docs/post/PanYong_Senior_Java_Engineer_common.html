## Work Experience

### Shanghai Zhongtong BlueNet Information Technology Co., Ltd.
> Java Tech Lead | Shanghai | 2023.08 - Present

#### Key Achievements:
1. I led a small technical team to deliver an e-commerce system that met business requirements within 3 months, laying the foundation for the operations team's recruitment and promotion.
2. I introduced an API-first development process based on OpenAPI 3.0, ensuring the consistency between documentation and code, and improving the parallel development efficiency between front-end and back-end by 30%.
3. I introduced MapStruct for model conversion, reducing code workload by 20% and increasing code reuse rate by 30% (related to model conversion).

#### Cold Chain E-commerce System
**Description**: The system consists of a WeChat mini-program, an operations platform, and a merchant platform. It provides basic data maintenance and review functions for the operations team, entry and store management functions for merchants, and an efficient and convenient shopping platform for users (cold chain-related products: refrigerants, packaging, tapes, etc.).
  It's based on SpringBoot, deployed on the company's k8s platform (ZKS), using MySQL to store data (with MybatisPlus as the ORM framework), using Redis to cache hot data to improve system throughput, using Kafka for asynchronous data exchange and business decoupling with upstream and downstream systems, and using ES for fast product data retrieval.

**Work Content:**

1. Responsible for the overall project design, including technology selection, database design, system architecture design, RESTful API design, and code quality.
2. Responsible for the development of core functional modules, such as products, orders, and payments.
3. Responsible for team collaboration and progress tracking, resolving multiple task bottlenecks, and completing assigned tasks on time and with quality.

********

### Coupang (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.

> Senior Java Engineer | Shanghai | 2020.03 - 2023.04

#### Key Achievements:
1. I implemented Bloom Filter to verify Barcodes with large data volumes and high concurrency, with a response latency of less than 100ms.
2. Optimized and solved multiple MySQL-related issues, such as slow queries, database deadlocks, and system OOMs.
3. Produced multiple technical documents and process specifications (such as Git management process), effectively improving team collaboration efficiency.

#### Supplier-Product Management System
**Description**: The system is responsible for maintaining the basic attributes of suppliers and products in the supply chain. Based on SpringBoot, using MySQL as the data storage (with JPA as the ORM framework), using Kafka for asynchronous data exchange and business decoupling with upstream and downstream systems, and using pylon-api for service registration and discovery.

**Work Content:**

1. Responsible for the maintenance work and new requirement development of the system.
2. Responsible for communication and collaboration with multiple internal teams, and performing maintenance work, such as EC2 OS image upgrade, Kafka management platform migration, and release system migration.
3. Responsible for the development of the content engine, modularizing the parsing/generation of dynamically configured Excel/CSV files, and functions like resumable upload, to improve code reusability and development efficiency.

****

### Zhongan Online P&C Insurance Co., Ltd.

> Senior Java Engineer | Shanghai | 2017.10 - 2020.03

#### Key Achievements:
1. Designed a unified authorization system for third-party access, simplifying the development process and improving the access efficiency.
2. Designed a bulk data export framework, using the producer-consumer pattern and SQL optimization, significantly reducing the time and memory consumption during Excel exports. The framework is convenient and universal, solving the OOM and frequent FullGC issues causing CPU overload during data exports.
3. Designed a media resource management system, migrating images, PDFs, and other media resources to Alibaba Cloud OSS, using asynchronous upload and download methods, reducing the upload/download pressure on the business system, and improving the I/O speed of media resources.

#### Genetic Testing Service Management System
**Description:** The system serves the company's genetic testing project, with main functions including sample box inventory management, order generation, delivery, return, test sample management, inspection, report generation, and user-facing sample binding and report viewing.

**Work Content:**

1. Responsible for the architecture design and technical transformation of the application layer, such as the third-party authorization system, configurable SMS management system, and user system transformation.
2. Responsible for the development and maintenance of the WeChat public account.
