#### Key Achievements:&#13;
1. I led a small technical team to deliver an e-commerce system that met business requirements within 3 months, laying the foundation for the operations team's recruitment and promotion.&#13;
2. I introduced an API-first development process based on OpenAPI 3.0, ensuring the consistency between documentation and code, and improving the parallel development efficiency between front-end and back-end by 30%.&#13;
3. I introduced MapStruct for model conversion, reducing code workload by 20% and increasing code reuse rate by 30% (related to model conversion).&#13;
&#13;
#### Cold Chain E-commerce System&#13;
**Description**: The system consists of a WeChat mini-program, an operations platform, and a merchant platform. It provides basic data maintenance and review functions for the operations team, entry and store management functions for merchants, and an efficient and convenient shopping platform for users (cold chain-related products: refrigerants, packaging, tapes, etc.).&#13;
  It's based on SpringBoot, deployed on the company's k8s platform (ZKS), using MySQL to store data (with MybatisPlus as the ORM framework), using Redis to cache hot data to improve system throughput, using Kafka for asynchronous data exchange and business decoupling with upstream and downstream systems, and using ES for fast product data retrieval.&#13;
&#13;
**Work Content:**&#13;
&#13;
1. Responsible for the overall project design, including technology selection, database design, system architecture design, RESTful API design, and code quality.&#13;
2. Responsible for the development of core functional modules, such as products, orders, and payments.&#13;
